            <h1>Computer Science</h1>
            <p>computer science, the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical
                 and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing
                  information. The discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms
                   and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information 
                   processes, and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its 
                   foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates
                    techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and 
                    electronic circuit design. Computer science also makes heavy use of hypothesis
                     testing and experimentation during the conceptualization, design, measurement,
                      and refinement of new algorithms, information structures, and computer 
                      architectures.  </p>

            <h1>How is Computer Science Different from IT?</h1>
            <p>Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software 
                systems. It involves working with mathematical models, data analysis and security,
                 algorithms, and computational theory. Computer scientists define the computational 
                 principles that are the basis of all software.<br>
                Information technology (IT) focuses on the development, implementation, support,
                 and management of computers and information systems. IT involves working both with
                  hardware (CPUs, RAM, hard disks) and software (operating systems, web browsers, 
                  mobile applications). IT professionals make sure that computers, networks, and 
                  systems work well for all users.</p>

            <h1>What Skills do Computer Scientists Need?</h1>
            <p>Learning how to program and code is only one element of the field. Computer scientists 
                design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all 
                kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts. And because computers
                 solve problems to serve and enrich people, there is a significant human component to 
                 computer science. Due to the range and complexity of the projects they take on, 
                 computer scientists depend on both technical knowledge and essential skills like 
                 communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Other useful skills 
                include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analytical and logical thinking</li>
                <li>Technical and mathematical skills</li>
                <li>Attention to detail</li>
                <li>Poject managment</li>
                <li>Technical writing</li>
                <li>Research</li>
                <li>Art and design</li>
            </ul>
